# Quadrature

Calculates the area under a curve using a variety of numerical integration formulas.
Eventually it should have support for adaptive quadrature, but for the time being it focuses on splitting an interval into uniform sub-intervals.
This project may evolve into my DP Analysis & Approaches SL IA, but I won't start that until some time my senior year.
